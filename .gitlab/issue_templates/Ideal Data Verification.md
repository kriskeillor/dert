**Verification Result**:
0 - Verification process was not completed.
1 - Requirement was NOT met.
2 - Requirement was NOT met, but the verification process was not ideal so the result may not be accurate or complete.
3 - Requirement *was* met, but the verification process was not ideal so the result may not be accurate or complete.
4 - Requirement *was* met.
X - Requirement was not approved, so it could not be verified.
